Project Abstract

Vaccination plays a critical role in preventing infectious diseases and promoting public health. Despite its importance, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal in many regions, leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases. The Vaccination Alert System (VAS) is designed to enhance vaccination compliance and coverage through timely reminders and alerts.

The VAS leverages modern technology to send personalized notifications to individuals about upcoming and overdue vaccinations. Utilizing data from healthcare providers, the system identifies patients who are due for vaccines and sends alerts via SMS, email, or app notifications. The alerts include information on the type of vaccine needed, the recommended vaccination schedule, and the nearest vaccination centers.

The system also incorporates educational content to address vaccine hesitancy by providing scientifically accurate information about the benefits and safety of vaccines. Additionally, VAS offers tracking features for parents and caregivers to monitor their children's vaccination status, ensuring that all doses are administered according to schedule.

Preliminary trials of the VAS have shown promising results, with increased vaccination rates and improved adherence to vaccination schedules. By streamlining communication between healthcare providers and patients, the Vaccination Alert System has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases and enhance public health outcomes.
